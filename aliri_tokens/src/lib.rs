//! Facilities for efficient background management of access tokens
//!
//! This library is intended to support some best practices for background management of
//! authentication tokens for clients such that they can make the right trade-offs with regard
//! to reliability of their own application and reliance on the backend authentication
//! system always being available to issue tokens.
//!
//! In particular, this moves considerations about whether a token needs to be refreshed to the
//! background, provides a grace period where the existing token can continue to be used while
//! attempts are made to obtain a fresher token, and contemplates a mechanism whereby multiple
//! short-lived instances (such as serverless functions) can cooperate in order to reduce the
//! need for an always-up authentication server.
//!
//! This is done in such a way that consumers of the tokens need be hardly aware that the
//! refreshes are happening in the background at all.
//!
//! # General Flow (Client Credentials)
//!
//! On application start-up, you will need to set up your source and any intermediate caching
//! layers.
//!
//! In the example below, we pull some credentials in and set up a token source to
//! perform a token exchange against an OAuth2 token backend. That set up includes some
//! configuration for determining when a token should be considered _stale_ and eligible for
//! renewal.
//!
//! We next set up a file cache so that we can persist the token locally. This allows us to
//! continue using the same token across application restarts or for multiple instances on
//! the same logical filesystem to share tokens. In the case of serverless functions, you
//! might want to implement a token cache that uses a private cache such as Redis or a
//! private table.
//!
//! Finally, we construct our final token source from these to elements and spawn a token
//! watcher which will automatically renew the token in the background as it becomes stale.
//! The actual time that it attempts to perform this refresh is controlled by a
//! [JitterSource][jitter::JitterSource], which helps prevent stampedes of renewal attempts
//! by multiple instances seeing a token go stale at the same time. An error backoff configuration
//! is also provided to introduce a reasonable means of reducing load when the token authority
//! returns an error.
//!

//!
//! # Features
//!
//! The following features are supported by this crate, all of which are enabled by default:
//!
//! * `oauth2`: Provides implementations of token refresh sources corresponding to the _client
//!   credentials_ and _refresh token_ flows.
//! * `file`: Provides implementations of a token refresh source and cache using the local
//!   filesystem.
//! * `rand`: Provides for an implementation of [JitterSource][jitter::JitterSource] based on the
//!   random number generator provided by the [rand] crate.
